The fraud blocklist was designed to draw attention to false information on certain news sites and strange domains on the internet. It's recommended to make your own whitelist because everyone has their own reason to unblock some websites due to certain scenarios.

Note: Some of the lists have "Temp," which means they were previously unavailable and we don't know when they will be restored. I used the Wayback Machine to get the file before the owner or website took it down.

Blocklist Type: Fraud
(Includes fraud and news.)

If anyone wants to copy the "Fraud" blocklist into Pihole, this is a simple copy list. Remember, there is a chance it could be blocked, in which case you might need to make a custom whitelist.
