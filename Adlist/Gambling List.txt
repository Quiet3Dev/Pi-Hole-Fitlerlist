The gambling blocklist was designed for pihole and just blocks some gambling sites through the DNS level, with a few porn and fake news sites included. It's recommended to make your own whitelist because everyone has their own reason to unblock some websites due to certain scenarios.

Note: Some of the lists have "Temp," which means they were previously unavailable and we don't know when they will be restored. I used the Wayback Machine to get the file before the owner or website took it down.

Blocklist Type: Gambling
(This includes gambling, porn, and fake news.)

If anyone wants to copy the "gambling" blocklist into Pihole, this is a simple copy list. Remember, there is a chance it could be blocked, in which case you might need to make a custom whitelist.
