The Other Blocklist was designed for Pi-Hole to block sites; this includes strange IP addresses, Gore, Ccleaner activation, Adobe activation, Flash Player blocking, and other strange sites with random data. It's recommended to make your own whitelist because everyone has their own reason to unblock some websites due to certain scenarios.

Note: Some of the lists have "Temp," which means they were previously unavailable and we don't know when they will be restored. I used Wayback Machine to get the file before the owner or website took it down.

Blocklist Type: Other
(Includes Gore, Adobe, CCleaner, Flash Player, Abuse, and Other)

This is an easy-to-copy list if anyone wants to copy the "Gore and Other" blocklist into Pi-Hole. Remember, there is a chance it could be overblocking, which might require making a custom whitelist.
