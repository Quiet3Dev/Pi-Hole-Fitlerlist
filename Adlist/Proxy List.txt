Proxy blocklists were designed for Pi-Hole to block proxies through the network using Pi-Hole. It's recommended to make your own whitelist because everyone has their own reason to unblock some websites due to certain scenarios.

Note: Some of the lists have "Temp," which means they were previously unavailable and we don't know when they will be restored. I used the Wayback Machine to get the file before the owner or website took it down.

Blocklist Type: Proxy
(Includes proxy and tracking)

This is an easy-to-copy list if anyone wants to copy the "Proxy" blocklist into Pi-Hole. Remember, there is a chance it could be blocked, in which case you might need to make a custom whitelist.
