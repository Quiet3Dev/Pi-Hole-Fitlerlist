Scam blocklists are designed for Pi-Hole to block scam sites and popups. Some ads, spam, and phishing have been added to the blocklist because some ads contain hidden links to other websites. It's recommended to make your own whitelist because everyone has their own reason to unblock some websites due to certain scenarios.

Note: Some of the lists have "Temp," which means they were previously unavailable and we don't know when they will be restored. I used the Wayback Machine to get the file before the owner or website took it down.

Blocklist Type: Scam
(This includes scams, spam, ads, and phishing.)
