A torrent blocklist is designed for Pi-Holes and is supposed to block torrent sites to prevent malicious actors from affecting the network. It's recommended to make your own whitelist because everyone has their own reason to unblock some websites due to certain scenarios.

Note: Some of the lists have "Temp," which means they were previously unavailable and we don't know when they will be restored. I used the Wayback Machine to get the file before the owner or website took it down.

Blocklist Type: Torrent
(Includes Torrent and Piracy)

This is an easy-to-copy list if anyone wants to copy the "Torrent" blocklist into Pi-Hole. Remember, there is a chance it could be blocked, in which case you might need to make a custom whitelist.
